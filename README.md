# Java-Practice
My progress in Java from a complete newbie.

I enrolled in the Java Programming Masterclass by the instructor Tim Buchalka on Udemy.
The masterclass has a variety of coding exercises where the the questions are quite easy to understand and then we have to brainstorm for our own solution.
Each question is checked on the software if it is copied from web(I think, but I'm being true to myself by solving these exercises diligently).
Here I have posted my answers for each question in the exercise. 
Each day represents my progress in coding. Even I myself can see how the way I write my code changes.
PS: I just recently started posting these questions here, so there is already some good amount of questions I have completed which I will be posting later on the day I did not do any latest coding exercise.
